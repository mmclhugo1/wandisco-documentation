title: How to safely shutdown and start up Hortonworks Sandbox and WANdisco Fusion
sidebar_label: Stop/Start HDP Sandbox & WANdisco Fusion
---

This guide is for when you want to safely shutdown or start up a Hortonworks Sandbox and WANdisco Fusion installation.

## Shutting down

The steps should be carried out prior to shutting down the Docker host itself.

### Shutdown HDP Sandbox services

Log in to the Ambari UI, and shutdown all services.

`http://<docker_IP_address>:8080`

Username: `admin`
Password: `admin`

**Ambari UI -> Services (...) -> Stop All -> CONFIRM STOP**

Wait until all services have shutdown before continuing.

### Stop all containers

1. Log in to the Docker host via a terminal session.

2. Switch to the fusion-docker-compose directory.

   `cd /path/to/fusion-docker-compose`

3. Stop all containers.

   `docker-compose stop`

   _Example output_

   ```text
   Stopping fusion-oneui-server               ... done
   Stopping fusion-server-adls2               ... done
   Stopping induction                         ... done
   Stopping fusion-ihc-server-adls2           ... done
   Stopping fusion-server-sandbox-hdp         ... done
   Stopping sshd-sandbox-hdp                  ... done
   Stopping fusion-ihc-server-sandbox-hdp     ... done
   Stopping fusion-nn-proxy-sandbox-hdp       ... done
   Stopping fusion-livehive-proxy-sandbox-hdp ... done
   Stopping fusion-ui-server-adls2            ... done
   Stopping fusion-ui-server-sandbox-hdp      ... done
   Stopping sandbox-hdp                       ... done
   Stopping debug                             ... done
   ```

### Shutdown the Docker host

If desired, you can now shut down the Docker host.

## Starting up

Ensure the Docker host is started before continuing.

### Start all containers

Follow the steps outlined below to start all containers.

1. Log in to the Docker host via a terminal session.

2. Switch to the fusion-docker-compose directory.

   `cd /path/to/fusion-docker-compose`

3. Verify that the containers are stopped.

   `docker-compose ps`

   All containers should have an `Exit` state.

4. Start all containers.

   `docker-compose start`

   _Example output_

   ```text
   Starting fusion-oneui-server               ... done
   Starting fusion-server-adls2               ... done
   Starting induction                         ... done
   Starting fusion-ihc-server-adls2           ... done
   Starting fusion-server-sandbox-hdp         ... done
   Starting sshd-sandbox-hdp                  ... done
   Starting fusion-ihc-server-sandbox-hdp     ... done
   Starting fusion-nn-proxy-sandbox-hdp       ... done
   Starting fusion-livehive-proxy-sandbox-hdp ... done
   Starting fusion-ui-server-adls2            ... done
   Starting fusion-ui-server-sandbox-hdp      ... done
   Starting sandbox-hdp                       ... done
   Starting debug                             ... done
   ```

The HDP sandbox services will automatically start once the container is running. This can take up to 5-10 minutes.
