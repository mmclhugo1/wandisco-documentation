### Business continuity in a distributed environment

  A new approach to large scale data replication ensures data consistency and availability, even during large scale data migrations / cloud migrations.

### Global data resiliency

  Continuous replication prevents data disasters.

### Always available data

  Users and applications can access and change data from any location.

### Improved application performance

  Eliminates latency, points of failure, and availability challenges associated with geo-distributed data regardless of distance.

### Ability to meet strict data SLAs

  Near-zero RPO/RTO removes data gaps inherent with point-in-time backups or snapshots, and enables a long-term strategy for meeting regulation compliance requirements.

### Reduced data gravity challenges

  Avoids cloud vendor lock-in and simplifies management of multiple cloud storage providers.

### Self-healing

  Eliminates the need for administrators to respond to system level failures with automated recovery.
